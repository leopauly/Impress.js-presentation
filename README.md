Impress.js-presentation : Artificial Neural Network
===================================================

This was my seminar presentation that i created using the javascript library Impress.js in html5.
The seminar was on Artificial Neural Newtwork and it consists of around 20 slides.It was prepared for a duration of 20-30 min.

The presentation can be downloaded and used by following the given steps:

1)Download the zip folder containing the reposistory and extract it to a suitable location.

2)Open the folder "Presentation_Artificial Neural network" from the parent folder "Impress.js-presentation-master".

3)Now to view the presentation open the following html files in a webbrowser:

a) ANN presentation.html : consists of all the slides for the presentation.Open it in a webbrowser.Now use space bar and arrow keys for moving forward and backward through the slides.

b)av1.html,av2.html,av3.html : they consists of very small clips showing working of a biological neural network,a single pitts-Mecculloch model and a neural network.

c)face.html : consists of a image that can be used to expain the difference between human intelligence and machine intelligence on performing tasks.
